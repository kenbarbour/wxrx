# WXRX Website Generation

This directory should contain at least two subdirectories:

* `public` is where wxrx will put generated website files.  Set it or symlink it to your web-server's
document root.
* `templates` is where you may place custom templates for wxrx to use to generate web pages.

## Templates

* `document.template` is used for generating any HTML document.  It uses the following variables:
  * `{{CONTENT}}` - the main content of the page, generated by other templates
  * `{{TITLE}}` - page title
  * `{{GENERATED_AT}}` - string description of the time the page was generated
  * `{{SCHEDULE}}` - Concatenated markup generated by `schedule-item.template`
* `index.template` - used for the site index
  * `{{CONTENT}}` - the main content of the page
* `item.template` is used for each satellite pass included in an index.
  * `{{URL}}` - url to the pass HTML page
  * `{{HEADING}}` - heading to describe the pass
  * `{{THUMBNAIL}}` - url to an image thumbnail for the pass
* `pass.template` is used to generate a page containing all the files for a single satellite pass
  * `{{TITLE}}` - page title for use in a heading
  * `{{CONTENT}}` - concatenated content for the items in this pass
* `pass-audio.template` is used to render markup to present the audio file for a pass
  * `{{WAV_FILE}}` - url to an audio file
* `pass-image.template` is used to render markup to present an image for a pass
  * `{{SRC}}` - image `src` attribute
  * `{{ALT}}` - `alt` attribute for the image
  * `{{CAPTION}}` - a string caption describing the image
* `schedule-item.template` generates the markup for a single predicted satellite pass
  * `{{DATE}}` - date and time of the beginning of the signal (above the horizon)
  * `{{SATELLITE}}` - satellite name (ex: NOAA 15)
  * `{{DURATION}}` - duration (in seconds) until loss of signal (below the horizon)
